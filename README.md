# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones


This project focuses on building a Human Activity Recognition system using smartphone sensor data. The goal is to classify daily activities such as walking, sitting, and standing using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

## 🚀 About the Project

Smartphones contain accelerometer and gyroscope sensors that capture motion signals. Using these signals, we train different algorithms to automatically detect human activities.

The main objective is to compare multiple algorithms and determine which performs best for activity classification.

## 📂 Dataset

We are using the **UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**.

Dataset includes:
- 561 extracted sensor features
- 6 activity classes
- Separate training and testing sets
- Preprocessed and normalized data

Since the dataset is publicly available, it is referenced instead of being uploaded.
